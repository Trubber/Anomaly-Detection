# Anomaly-Detection
Assignment 2 for Machine learning

The following packages are needed:
    - NumPy
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn

With the packages installed the program should simply be able to run with hitting the play button in VSCode or through the command line with "python assignment2.py".
Within the main there are sections for hyperparater tuning which are commented out by default, and the metrics printed out for KMeans can be turned off by setting the metrics variable to False.
